# the plot() function shows the association of each variable against the other one in a data
# handy for data with few number of variables to see if there are any patterns

# ggplot, the gg in ggplot stands for grammar of graphics
# grammar of graphics basically says any graphical representation of data, can be produced by a series of layers
# You can think of a layer as a plastic transparency

# Lets draw the same plot using ggplot
# Always, mention the data we are going to work with
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety))

# aes: aes which stands for aesthetics is a relationship between a variable in your dataset and an aspect of 
# of the plot that is going to visually convey the information to the reader

# Visual elements are known as geoms (short for 'geometric objects') in ggplot 2
# When we define a layer, we have to tell R what geom we want displayed on that layer (do we want a bar, line dot, etc.?)

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety))+ geom_point()

# below show the "Aesthetics" part of the help page and explain it mate
?geom_point

# So, lets try some of them here like shape and size
# be careful with the + sign, if you clink enter for the next part of the code, the + sign should not go to the next line

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety))+
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 8)


# the current plot is not very informative about the patterns for each gender

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety, color = Gender))+
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 10)

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety, color = Gender, shape = Gender))+
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 10)

# Question: why the above code doesn't make any change?

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety, color = Gender, shape = Gender))+
  geom_point(size = 2)


# Can assign the first layer to a variable to reduce the length of codes for next layers
My_graph <- ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Exam, y = Anxiety))

My_graph + geom_point()


## lets add a line to the current graph

My_graph + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

# aesthetics can be set for all layers of the plot (i.e., defined in the plot as a whole) or can be set individually for each geom in a plot

My_graph + geom_point(aes(color = Gender)) + geom_smooth()

My_graph + geom_point(aes(color = Gender)) + geom_smooth(aes(color = Gender))



# The shaded area around the line is the 95% confidence interval around the line.
# We can switch this off by  adding se = F (which is short for 'standard error = False')

My_graph + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F)

# what if we want our line to be a direct line?
My_graph + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = lm)

# How to change the labels of x and y axes?
My_graph + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = F, method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Exam scores %", y = "Anxiety scores")


# Histogram and bar charts
# Histograms are used to show distributions of variables while bar charts are used to compare variables. 
# Histograms plot quantitative data with ranges of the data grouped into bins or intervals while bar charts plot categorical data.

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Anxiety, y = Exam )) + geom_histogram()
# the code above gives an error as geom_histogram can only have x or y axis in its aes()

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Anxiety)) + geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(y = Anxiety)) + geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Anxiety)) + geom_histogram(bins = 31)

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Anxiety)) + geom_histogram(bins = 31, fill = "green", col = "red")





# lets stop using the My_graph variable and write the whole code from the start again for a bar chart

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Sleep_quality))+
  geom_bar()

# Because we want to plot a summary of the data (the mean) rather than the raw scores themselves, we have to use a stat.

ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Sleep_quality, y = Exam, fill = Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")


ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Sleep_quality, y = Exam, fill = Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", position = "dodge")


# the other way to get the same plot that the code above gives, is using the stat_summary function that takes the following general form: 
#stat_summary(function = x, geom = y)
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = Sleep_quality, y = Exam, fill = Gender))+
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "bar", position = "dodge")


# How to combine multiple plots? We can use the patchwork package.

library(patchwork)

# Lets assign our graphs to new names

p1 = My_graph + geom_point(aes(color = Gender)) + geom_smooth()
